# AdLara Bootstrap

Laravel VueJS/Vuetify Powered admin, booting up required components that separates Admin and Front and provides rich tools such as Media Library

# What will this bootstraping do? 

- Ready to go Laravel/Vue/Vuetify Admin
- Sample Blog, ready to extend or use
- Provides Multiple Authentication for the Front end and the Back end (Admin)
- Creates Separate Controllers Folders (AdminControllers and FrontControllers)
- Separate Route files, for admin -> admin.php and for front-end web.php 
- Separte views for admin and front end so that the application remains organized and flows well 
- Media Management: Manage static assets of your application through database. It provides boiler plate to record every upload in the database. Of course, it has Rich Media Library built with VueJs (https://vuejs.org) and Uppy.io (https://uppy.io/). 
- The media library reduces the time consuming tasks of creating uploading functionality and manage it and speed-up the other tasks
